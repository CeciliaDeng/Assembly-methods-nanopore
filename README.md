# Assembly methods for nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing: a comparative study

This repository is intended to mantain and update the data of our work ["Assembly methods for nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing: a comparative study"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/722405v1.full), and to include all the suppplementary files and scripts used. 

We are currently working in an update of the benchmarking, which will include new assemblers, figures and data. Results will be deposited in this repository as soon as possible.

Stay tuned!
