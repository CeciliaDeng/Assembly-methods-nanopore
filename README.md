# Assembly methods for nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing: a comparative study

This repository is intended to mantain and update the data of our work ["Assembly methods for nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing: a comparative study"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/722405v1.full), and to include all the suppplementary files and scripts used. 

We are currently working in an update of the benchmarking, which will include new assemblers and figures. Results will be deposited in this repository as soon as possible.

For a full discussion of the current results, please visit the [bioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/722405v1.full).

Stay tuned!

## Workflow

For impatient people: this is our personal pipeline recommendation for metagenomic assembly based on ONT sequences. The workflow could change by the time we perform new evaluations including different assemblers or data.

It has to be noted that we recommend to try different assemblers on your data in order to get a broader spectrum of what's in your samples!
